## Team Name: Jose James Team
## Team Memebere: Jose James - Viswajyothi College of Engineering and Technology

## Project Description
- Like its name, it is a chaos analyzer that judges a room or environment based MIT level chaos metrics to say how messy it thinks the room is.


## The Problem
- It is only fair that people need to use an ai tool to judge how messy their surroundings are.
- Its just too difficult and too much of a work to look at your surroundings and make the judgement.

## The Solution
- *So*, the solution is simple. Just make the AI do the work.
-  You can just upload the image or take one directly from the page.
-  Next ask it to analyze.
-  It will give a percentage rating, a comment on how messy the room is, and then give bunch of technical jargon that you may not understand.
-  Also there are different views at the bottomâ€”annotation, edges, and heatmap
